# LAB-1 — Virtual Network Lab (CI-Driven)

This project demonstrates a production-style workflow for building and validating
infrastructure labs using GitHub Actions.

## What this shows
- Infrastructure-as-code mindset
- CI pipelines validating environments automatically
- Comfort with Linux, networking, and cloud-style workflows
- Ability to work without relying on local machine state

## Tech Used
- GitHub Actions (CI)
- Linux networking concepts
- Container / virtualization tooling
- Bash scripting

## Why this matters
This lab runs automatically in CI, proving the setup works independently
of the developer’s machine — similar to real-world cloud systems.
